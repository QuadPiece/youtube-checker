# parse.py

Alright, this thing just checks for dead YouTube links. Originally made for [a friend](http://twitter.com/benjisild),
but I'll leave the code here because why not.

_Note: The videos must have the link format
 `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VideoID`
 because I'm too lazy for RegEx and shit._

## Using this

Do the standard python shit
 ( navigate to the folder, create virtual environment, and so on)

* Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Place your HTML file with links to YouTube videos in the folder and name it index.html
* `python3 parse.py`
* ???
* PROFIT (Hopefully)

## End note

As I said, this was made for
 [a friend](http://twitter.com/benjisild) who needed it for a pretty special case.
 I doubt anyone else will have a need for this,
 but it's here if someone wants to learn by reading python code 
 or use it as a starting point for their own little thing.
